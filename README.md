Small Indie Horror Game made by two college Juniors


Welcome to the small Indie game that myself and a friend of mine made from scratch (with the help of some Unreal store assets). Its a fairly short playthrough once 
you know everything, but it can be a bit challenging finding all three of the locations required. Best of luck!

Requirments:
  - When downloading the project be sure you clone the repository and dont download the files as a zip. If its downloaded as a zip then the executable wont run properly.
  - It may require you to have Git LFS installed to initilzed the repository when clones. I cant say 100% however, since I already had it installed when I tested the clone.
